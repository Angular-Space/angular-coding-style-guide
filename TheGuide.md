# Angular Style Guide

### Introduction
Angular style guides are widely debated, but it’s essential to remember they are just that—guidelines. The key is to find what best supports your team’s capabilities and objectives. 

### Focus on Developer Experience
While some style choices can enhance readability and maintainability, overly strict rules can hinder productivity. Instead, teams should strike a balance that promotes developer experience and meets project goals. Most applications don’t need to be optimised for maximum speed from day one; prioritise features over rigid rules when possible.

### Testing for Longevity
Tests are crucial for adapting to future needs. A comprehensive test suite is the best investment you can make for scalability and maintenance.

### Design Language System
Anchor your code around a consistent design language system. To handle breaking changes, use a semantic versioning approach, implementing migrations as needed.

### Company Schematics
Create company-specific schematics for generating components, services, and directives to ensure consistency across the codebase.
